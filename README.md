# Todo-List
Web App

I have created this app using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, I already created todo list using react also but in this project i have use the concept of local storage.

how to run this project :-
1. Download and unzip the file
2. and just run index.html in browser

Functionality :-
1. It is not required to press button always enter key could be use to add tasks, update tasks
2. If tasks list are to large then there is a top button to scroll on top.
3. there is a button to create new list.
4. if a tasks is completed we can just remove it from the list.

   Thankyou.
